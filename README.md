> **This is a fork** of [hassio-bluetti-bt](https://github.com/Patrick762/hassio-bluetti-bt) by [Patrick762](https://github.com/Patrick762), paired with a fork of the underlying [bluetti-bt-lib](https://github.com/Ellmondo/bluetti-bt-connect-lib). All credit for the original integration architecture, protocol reverse-engineering, and core design goes to Patrick762 and the project's other contributors. This fork exists to track device-specific fixes and additions (notably for the Bluetti EP2000) on a faster iteration cycle; where possible, improvements are intended to be contributed back upstream.

Bluetti Integration for Home Assistant

## Disclaimer
This integration is provided without any warranty or support by Bluetti. I do not take responsibility for any problems it may cause in all cases. Use it at your own risk.

## ⚠️ EP2000: grid/mode controls carry real risk - read before using

AC Output, Charge From Grid, Grid Export, Working Mode, and all four grid import/export power and current limits remain writable controls in this build. Writes into the grid-related settings on this device were found to sometimes get a clean acknowledgment from Home Assistant without the change actually taking effect on the device - a silent failure with no error shown anywhere. **Do not assume a setting change has taken effect just because Home Assistant accepted it without error** - verify independently (in the official Bluetti app, or against real grid behavior) before relying on any change you make here. This matches a well-documented industry-wide pattern of grid-compliance settings being authentication-gated across comparable solar/battery hardware, not something specific to this fork - and it's worth knowing that grid-export and grid-protection parameters are also regulated for interconnection safety in most jurisdictions, independent of whether a given write actually persists.

**Full technical detail and the research behind this warning are in the [bluetti-bt-connect-lib README](https://github.com/Ellmondo/bluetti-bt-connect-lib#readme)** (look for the "grid/mode controls carry real risk" section near the top) - read that before relying on any of these controls, or before filing an issue if one doesn't seem to work.

## Installation
To install this integration, you first need [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed.
After the installation, you can add this repository as a custom repository in HACS, or use this button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Ellmondo&repository=bluetti-bt-connect&category=integration)

### Supported devices:

See [bluetti-bt-connect-lib](https://github.com/Ellmondo/bluetti-bt-connect-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-powerstations-and-data)

### Available controls:
See [bluetti-bt-connect-lib](https://github.com/Ellmondo/bluetti-bt-connect-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-powerstations-and-data)

### Adding devices or fields

Please open an issue on this repository, or see the upstream issue template at [bluetti-bt-lib](https://github.com/Patrick762/bluetti-bt-lib?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-powerstations-and-data) for the general contribution format.

## Note on domain change

This fork uses the Home Assistant integration domain `bluetti_bt_connect` (rather than `bluetti_bt`) to avoid conflicting with the original integration if both are ever installed side by side. If migrating from the original `hassio-bluetti-bt`, you will need to remove the old integration and re-add this one - existing entities and history will not carry over automatically.
